### Here's what's new in Omnivore

It has been a busy few months in the [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) community and we wanted to share some of our favorite updates with you. If you’d like to get involved in our community and help steer the direction of Omnivore, [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/h2z5rppzz9).

Here’s whats new:

On the web we added a new left menu to make it easier to filter your library and find your subscriptions. The left menu has your saved searches, your subscriptions, and a label filter you can use to build more complex queries. In the future we will allow you to edit the saved searches.

Tip: use the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 keys to quickly change the current search.

## Improved Newsletter Classifier

One issue new users ran into was our newsletter classifier. When Omnivore receives an email from a newsletter provider, we try to detect whether or not its an issue of a newsletter, or if its something like a confirmation email or message from the author. If its not an issue we forward it to your personal email so you can handle it. We’ve made some big upgrades to this classifier, so less messages will be flagged as non-article.

Tip: you can see all your recently received emails and how they were classified at <https://omnivore.app/settings/emails/recent>

## Obsidian Plugin

Woah boy, big news. We released an [Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/omnivore-app/obsidian-omnivore)! The plugin can import all your highlights and notes from Omnivore into Obsidian. If you’d like you can even import entire article content.

For more info checkout the [Obsidian plugin repo](https://github.com/omnivore-app/obsidian-omnivore) and our [docs page](https://docs.omnivore.app/integrations/obsidian.html).

## Markdown for highlights and notes

Our biggest change was to how we store highlights and notes. All highlights are now captured and stored as Markdown. This means things like lists, images, and links are preserved in highlighted content and your notes can be nicely formatted.

When you sync your highlights and notes into [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the Markdown will be preserved, so all that data will be included.

## Article notes

We added the ability to create top level notes to our Notebooks. This means you can easily write your thoughts on an article, without having to create any highlights. And yes, of course these can be synced into Logseq or Obsidian.

Tip: tap \`t\` in the reader view to open your notebook.

## Reader Themes

We added two new themes to the reader view: Sepia and Apollo.

On [iOS](https://omnivore.app/install/ios) we added a new ‘Continue Reading’ section at the top of the library. This helps you easily pick up your reading where you left off and is especially useful when switching devices.

Tip: you can also pin items in this area by adding a Pinned label to them

## Ultra Realistic Voices

For english users we’ve started beta testing our ultra realistic voices. You can enable these in the text to speech voice selector.

## New Text to Speech user interface

On iOS we’ve created a new user interface for text-to-speech. We wanted to make it easier to skip through text and get to the interesting parts of an article.

## Docs

We created [docs.omnivore.app](https://docs.omnivore.app/) and have been lucky enough to receive community translations to [Chinese](https://docs.omnivore.app/zh/) and [Spanish](https://docs.omnivore.app/using/install).
