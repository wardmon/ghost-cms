Service Worker Recipes
Basic Demo - a sample covering a basic, common use case. It precaches a set of local resources in a versioned cache, and maintains another cache that's populated at runtime as additional resources are requested.

Simple registration - a bare-bones sample that simply performs service worker registration, with placeholders for various event handlers.

Detailed registration - a sample that provides detailed information about the service worker registration and the state changes that a service worker undergoes.

Prefetching resources during installation - a sample demonstrating how to prefetch and cache a list of URLs during the service worker's installation, ensuring that they're available offline.

Selective caching - a sample of how a service worker can cache resources "on the fly", assuming the resources meet certain criteria (MIME type, domain, etc.).

Read-through caching - a sample of caching all resources that are requested "on the fly", unconditionally.

Offline Google Analytics - extends the read-through caching example to add in support for "replaying" failed Google Analytics pings, allowing pages to submit Google Analytics data associated with offline/cached page views.

Fallback responses - a sample illustrating how you can return alternative "fallback" content if an initial fetch request fails.

Mock responses - a sample illustrating how you can return content created on the fly in response to a page's requests.

Using postMessage - a sample illustrating the use of postMessage() to send commands from a controlled page to its service worker, giving the page control over the cache.

Multiple fetch handlers - a sample illustrating multiple fetch handlers, each of which intercepts a different type of request.

Custom offline page - a sample showing how to display a custom "Sorry, you're offline." error page when a network request fails.

Immediate control - a sample showing how to use skipWaiting() and clients.claim() to force a new service worker to take control of the page that just registered it.

Using window.caches - a sample showing how window.caches provides access to the Cache Storage API.

Using WindowClient.navigate() - a sample showing how a service worker can cause web page clients it controls to navigate to a given URL.

Foreign Fetch - a sample showing a client making use of the foreign fetch service worker deployed by a third-party service.
