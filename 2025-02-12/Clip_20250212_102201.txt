    comment: Actually invokes any executable program on your system.
             The program must be available in current path.
             Run any program you fancy.
             Here we're running the powershell executable.
             We're just using powershell's echo for an easy demo,
             but you can invoke any powershell command you like instead.
    in:
      cmd: powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "echo 'this is step 2'"
