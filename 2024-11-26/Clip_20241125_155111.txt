# Pandas uses something called a dataframe. It is a 
# 2D data structure that can hold multiple data types.
# Columns have labels.

# Series are built on top of NumPy arrays. 
# Create a series by first creating a list
list_1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
# I can define that I want the series indexes to be the
# provided labels
labels = [1, 2, 3, 4]
ser_1 = pd.Series(data=list_1, index=labels)
